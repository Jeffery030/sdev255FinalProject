This is a project that we plan to do in the classroom (mostly) that is similar to some of the tutorials, especially from Chapter 9. We will attempt to create our own integration of Vue.js and Node.js. It will probably be closely modeled on what is illustrated in Chapter 9. 
We will collaborate together using the Chapter 9 example of a complete client-side and server-side application using vue.js and node.js. As we have learned previously, it will be integrated with Express and MongoDB. We will look at the whole program, and then apply our ideas to the code, change it, and make it unique for our desired outcome.
